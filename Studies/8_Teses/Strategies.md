Reference Paper Methodologies and Algorithms:

- Use KDD methodology to extract information about the database.
- Bayesian Network-Based Knowledge Graph Inference.

-----

Pipeline Strategies:

- Isolate features and see the time progression.
- Propose decision trees to each of the nelson rules applied to the features time progression.
- Apply correlation strategies to see the correlation between the features and the labeling, that will show the most important features.
- Apply unsupervised clustering algorithms to see how the dataset is dispose, in different dimensionality, it also helps finding outliers in data.
- Apply polynomial regression in the time series features and the labeling feature, to forecast the next appearance of an error.
