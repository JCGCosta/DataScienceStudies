The data types are split in Qualitative (Categorical) and Quantitative data, and can be classified into majorly four categories:
- [[Nominal (Qualitative)]]: Is used to label things without any order or quantitative value (colour of hair, gender, nationality, eye color, marital status).
- [[Ordinal (Qualitative)]]: Qualitative data for which their values have some kind of relative position (Experience or Satisfaction in scale, ranking of people).
- [[Discrete (Qualitative)]]: The data are numerical and countable, having finite values (cost of a product, number of employees, days in a week), represented by a integer.
- [[Continuos (Qualitative)]]: Is represented by a defined range of values, normally by measures (weight, height, temperature, speed).
