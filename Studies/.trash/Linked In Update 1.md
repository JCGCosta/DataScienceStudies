I'm a Computer Science Student and also a Msc. Student in Computing, currently enrolled in a double degree between the Federal University of Technology - Paraná - Brazil and the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança - Portugal. I have almost 10 years of experience in the Computing and Computer Science area. In those years i worked for companies and projects in the automotive and aviation sectors.

In the academic part, i had proposed a classification algorithm for supervised learning, and a methodology to extract information with association rules, these two works became two articles both being published in academic journals.

In the business environment, i like thinking about ways to solve complex computational problems and better ways to adapt the business rules to the new emerging technologies.

The programming languages I'm most involved now a days are: Python, C#, Java, Dart, C, C++.
The technologies, frameworks and libraries that I most use are: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, tensorflow, openCV, flutter, asp.NET, mySQL, SQLite, mongoDB. I'm also familiar with the API pipelines, Restful APIs and Cloud Computing.

If you are interested in delving deeper into my work, I invite you to explore my Github code repository and my Lattes academic curriculum.

I mostly worked with new alternatives to the Lane Detection algorithm part of the Lane Departure Warning System, these detections could capture measurements about the lane size in real time, then providing reliable data to other Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

Programming languages: Python, C++.
Technologies, frameworks and libraries: numpy, openCV, CUDA, makefile.

These was my first contact with computers and programming, there i had the opportunity to develop projects, such as games and e-commerces. Also, my final project was awarded as the best project at the Expo ETEP 2016 event.

Programming languages: C#, Visual Basic, Java.
Technologies, frameworks and libraries: MySQL, Asp.NET.

A research that involves the extraction of association rules in datasets from road accidents at Paraná State in 2021. It was proposed some pre-processing strategies to get better results in applying the Apriori algorithm to extract association rules, the project was part of the: Institutional volunteer program in scientific and technological initiation.

Technologies: Weka.

A research that proposes a new algorithm to instance classification and prediction in the supervised-learning area. The algorithm has great inspiration in the KNN and SVM algorithms, as it also uses euclidean distance, but it can handle chaotic situations for those two algorithms.

Programming languages: Python.
Technologies, frameworks and libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
